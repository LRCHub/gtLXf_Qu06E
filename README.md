# ONE OK ROCK – Free Them

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
THEY WERE LAUGHING AT ME
ALL THE SONGS THAT I SING
SAYING THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME
AND I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING
THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE ME
THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SAID
SINCE THIS CROWD OF EMOTIONS
CAME TO LIVE IN MY HEAD
THERE'S A CROWD OF EMOTIONS
CAN'T GET OUT OF MY HEAD
AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO
FREE THEM FREE THEM
LET THEM FLY
I JUST WANT A CHANCE TO
FREE THEM
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
ALWAYS GOING FULL SPEED
I WAS RUNNING SO HARD
COULDN'T HEAR MYSELF BREATHING
JUST THE DRUMS IN MY HEART
I CAN TELL THAT YOU NOTICE
ALL THE THINGS I KEEP DOWN
CAN I LEAVE MYSELF OPEN
AND LET THEM ALL OUT
AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO
FREE THEM FREE THEM
LET THEM FLY
I JUST WANT A CHANCE TO
FREE THEM
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
LET THEM OUT OF MIND
TAKE THIS CROWD OF EMOTIONS
LET THEM OUT OF MY HEAD
AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS CHANCE TO
FREE THEM FREE THEM
LET THEM FLY
I JUST WAIT A CHANCE TO
FREE THEM
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
LET THEM OUT OF MY MIND
